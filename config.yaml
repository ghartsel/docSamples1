    description: |
      I've had the pleasure of writing complex developer and engineering documentation for great companies across a broad domain spectrum. These projects afforded me the opportunity to immerse myself in new technologies and engage with the latest documentation methodologies and tools.

      These are some of the types of documentation products I created:
      - &squarf; Web API, native API, and CLI references and user guides
      - &squarf; Tutorials and cookbooks
      - &squarf; Hardware reference guides and technical notes
      - &squarf; Software design and methodology specifications
      - &squarf; Various tool and technology user guides

      Where code examples are shown in the docs, I wrote and tested original code using the target programming or scripting language.

      Feel free to browse the publications and reach out if you have any questions: gene@gh.works.

          OmniSci Vega User Guide
        summary:
          As one of several areas I documented for the GPU-based SQL database, I documented the OmniSci interface to the Vega
          data visualization library, integrating the Vega language with SQL. The documentation opens with an at-a-glance
          tutorial to provide context followed by a set of tutorials of increasing complexity that walk the developer through
          OmniSci and Vega features.

          As a consultant, I provided the first documentation for the Ion Torrent DNA sequencing machine. The documentation
          included a programming guide and REST API reference documentation. Pre-OpenAPI, I created a Python tool to traverse
          resources and autogenerate the REST API. I would later employ a similar mechanism at Splunk.

          Single-board computer with Integrated Data Acquisition and Configurable CPU
        summary:
          One of several hardware modules I documented, I provided a detailed reference for how to configure and use this
          single-board computer. For all documentation, I created an XSLT-based documentation tool that allowed WYSIWYG
          authoring by publishing OpenOffice ODF formatted files to HTML and PDF formats. I presented the tool and methodology,
          which sought alignment with the Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA), at STC Silicon Valley.
