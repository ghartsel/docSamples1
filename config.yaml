    description: |
      I've had the pleasure of writing complex developer and engineering documentation for great companies across a broad domain spectrum. These projects afforded me the opportunity to immerse myself in new technologies and engage with the latest documentation methodologies and tools.

      These are some of the types of documentation products I created:
      - &squarf; Web API, native API, and CLI references and user guides
      - &squarf; Tutorials and cookbooks
      - &squarf; Hardware reference guides and technical notes
      - &squarf; Software design and methodology specifications
      - &squarf; Various tool and technology user guides

      Where code examples are shown in the docs, I wrote and tested original code using the target programming or scripting language.

      Feel free to browse the publications and reach out if you have any questions: gene@gh.works.

        summary:
          As the lone tech writer, I was responsible for the
          information architecture, content, CI/CD workflow, docs-as-code process, and Markdown and GitHub style guides.
          I implemented processes and tooling to ensure high documentation quality.

          Splunk REST API Reference
        summary:
          In volunteering to take responsibility for the REST API, I defined a developer-friendly API documentation format
          and replaced the existing automated documentation generation tool. OpenAPI was not an option.

          OmniSci Vega User Guide
        summary:
          As one of several areas I documented for the GPU-based SQL database, I documented the OmniSci interface to the Vega
          data visualization library, integrating the Vega language with SQL. The documentation opens with an at-a-glance
          tutorial to provide context followed by a set of tutorials of increasing complexity that walk the developer through
          OmniSci and Vega features.

          Juniper Networks WAN SDN Controller Developer Guide
        summary:
          As a consultant, I wrote the developer guide for the Juniper Networks NorthStar WAN SDN Controller to describe
          how to create applications that provided visibility and control over IP/MPLS and optical layer flows for WAN
          analysis and optimization, using the REST API.

          Ion Torrent Programming Guide with REST API Reference
        summary:
          As a consultant, I provided the first documentation for the Ion Torrent DNA sequencing machine. The documentation
          included a programming guide and REST API reference documentation. Pre-OpenAPI, I created a Python tool to traverse
          resources and autogenerate the REST API. I would later employ a similar mechanism at Splunk.

        summary:
          I worked with hardware engineers to document the UI for the STMicroelectronics STR9 configuration
          tool, assisting in debugging the tool. My previous experience writing board support packages, device drivers,
          and operating systems proved valuable in producing complete and accurate documentation.

          Single-board computer with Integrated Data Acquisition and Configurable CPU
        summary:
          One of several hardware modules I documented, I provided a detailed reference for how to configure and use this
          single-board computer. For all documentation, I created an XSLT-based documentation tool that allowed WYSIWYG
          authoring by publishing OpenOffice ODF formatted files to HTML and PDF formats. I presented the tool and methodology,
          which sought alignment with the Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA), at STC Silicon Valley.
